       when building a gap array, we divide the
       right bwt into many segments, so as to
       make each segment shorter than
       build_gap_gran.  the position of
       positionally the last character in a
       segment (which is the character whose
       position in the left array is determined
       FIRST, as we scan backward) is found
       by a binary search. positions of all
       other characters are found by
       LF-mapping. since the binary search is
       more costly than a LF-mapping, making
       this number too small makes binary search
       more frequent.  if we make this number
       too large, you may lose parallelism.
       theoretically, we want to avoid order n
       serial computation, so we want to make
       it a constant not depending on n, or
       something like log(n).
       if 0, the algorithm computes an appropriate
       choice based on n and n_approx_workers.

       it chooses a reasonable constant.

       the number of characters to insert
       between i-th and (i+1)-th elements of
       the left array. we like to transform
       the gap info into the prefix sum, so 
       as to know the position to which each
       character in the right array goes.
       we of course do not have the luxury
       of having the array having as many elements
       as the original left array, so we 
       sparsely store samples of the resulting
       prefix sum array. gap_sum_gran is
       the interval at which these samples are
       taken.  if you increase this number,
       we use less memory for the prefix array,
       but determining the position of each
       character takes more time
       (roughly proportional to gap_sum_gran).
       as a rule of thum, you want to make
       8n/gap_sum_gran much smaller than n,
       so you want to make gap_sum_gran larger
       enough than 8, usually 128 or something.
